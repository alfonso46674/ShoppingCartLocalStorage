# ShoppingCartLocalStorage
Small project that simulates a shopping cart from an e-commerce page.
Lets you add courses to the shopping cart, delete one course at a time, or remove all at the same time.
The courses that are in the cart are stored in local storage so that they are not lost when refreshing the page.
